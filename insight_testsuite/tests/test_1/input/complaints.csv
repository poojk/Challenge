3/5/2019	Mortgage	Conventional home mortgage	Trouble during payment process		"This complaint dates back to last XX/XX/XXXX during a loan modification which was done with XXXX ( Account # XXXX ) my previous loan servicer this was after a 2 month forbearance after Hurricane Irma. They had indicated a shortage to my escrow account in the loan modification documents. I was provided different information every time I spoke on the phone with a XXXX   representative. One would say I had an overage, others would say I had a shortage. The modification documents indicated at {$1900.00} shortage. I called, I emailed and wrote letters, I requested a Escrow review of my account in XXXX and XXXX and was told one would be done. They kept delaying and I finally had to sign the Modification documents on XX/XX/XXXX under duress otherwise the Modification would be withdrawn. No review of my escrow was ever done by XXXX, I discovered what appears to be an error when I reviewed the two Escrow Disclosure statements from XXXX for XXXX and XXXX. The Escrow balance for XX/XX/XXXX shows an actual escrow balance of {$2200.00}, the next statement shows a XXXX actual balance for XXXX, a difference of XXXX when only XXXX should have been withdrawn from this account to pay for the monthly mortgage insurance. I have recently contacted by phone and email to XXXX and they have not responded. 

In XX/XX/XXXX my loan servicing was transferred to Mr Cooper ( Formerly Nationstar Mortgage. ) ( Account # XXXX ). Mr Cooper did do a escrow analysis in XXXX of XXXX. That analysis was completely mishandled and they indicate a shortage of XXXX in my account. Even though my account is currently at a XXXX deficit as of XX/XX/XXXX. Their major errors was their analysis to my Hazard insurance and Morgage insurance. They indicated the Hazard insurance was XXXX last year ( when it was actually XXXX ) and this year the correct amount of XXXX. The Mortgage insurance they again misquoted last year at XXXX ( the actual was XXXX ) and listed this year the correct amount at XXXX so they are showing a difference from last year to this year of XXXX increase. This is totally wrong. They are demanding the difference be paid in a lump sum or have my monthly payment increased to cover the shortage over a year period. I have contacted Mr Cooper by phone on  XX/XX/XXXX and was told someone would look at it but no one from their Escrow will call, just an email. I have also sent a letter stating the error. The new charges will be taking effect in XXXX so something needs to happen quickly. The simple facts are that my Hazard insurance has gone down from XXXX to XXXX. My taxes did go up from XXXX to XXXX, so the net effect of the two is only XXXX. I am already paying one shortage based on XXXX miscalculation and that was to be spread out over 5 years. 
I want both XXXX and Mr Copper to correct the errors made to my escrow account and have XXXX send the deficiency to Mr Cooper post haste. I want Mr Cooper to revise the shortage based on all of this information.
